# hour_logger

hour_logger is a simple command line app for logging your work hours and managing the money you make at work.

  - You can start and end shifts, and see the duration that you worked for
  - You can see how much money you expect to earn in these shifts
  - You can record the money that you received on your paychecks, and hour_logger will keep a running tally of the pending payments

### Installation

You will need [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your /usr/local/bin directory as the executable 'python3'. For other configs, change the first line of './hour_logger.py' appropriately.

For installation:
```sh
$ cd <repo_directory>
$ chmod a+x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
```

This will add a symbolic link 'hours' to your '/usr/local/bin/' directory for the main 'hour_logger.py' file, and give it executable permissions. You may need to restart your terminal session. The following sections assume that '/usr/local/bin/' is in your PATH.

### Usage

Before using, you need to configure the app like this, assuming you make $30/hour:

```sh
$ hours --config -logfile path/to/logfile.log -rate 30
```

Then for starting a shift:
```sh
$ hours --start
```

And for ending a shift:
```sh
$ hours --end
```

On receiving a paycheck of, say, $100.24:
```sh
$ hours --payment 100.24
```

Other options:
```sh
# For deleting the log file
$ hours --clear

# For deleting all the current config settings
$ hours --rconfig

# For deleting the log file and config settings
$ hours --reset

# If contributing, and want to see the entire Python exception stack trace,
# use --debug flag with any other option. e.g.:
$ hours --payment 34.5 --debug
```
